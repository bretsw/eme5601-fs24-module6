# `r fa("fas fa-utensils", fill = "#fff")` Work Analysis

Work analysis is the **an important step** in the iterative design cycle:

### How do you decide if a design is good or bad?

---

# `r fa("fas fa-mug-hot", fill = "#fff")` Design & Development

--

  - *Performance objectives:* what learners should be able to do after instruction

--

- **Learner Activities:** what learners do during a planned learning experience

--

  - Can be designed for *knowledge*, *feelings*, *skills*, or some mix of these.

--

- **Goal Analysis:** turning warm fuzzies into specific and measurable targets

# `r fa("fas fa-mug-hot", fill = "#fff")`  Writing Objectives

--

- "On completion of instruction, learners should be able to..."

--

- Focus on **performance**: how a learner will demonstrate proficiency

--

- Name **criteria**: how well a learner must perform to demonstrate competence (process or product)

--

- Name **conditions**: what must exist when the learner demonstrates their knowledge, skill, or ability

--

- Think about **sequence**: appropriate order for learning

--

```{r, out.width = "360px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/teapot2.png")
```

### How can the desired results of instruction (i.e., the objectives) be achieved?

--

- **Instructional Strategy:** overall plan governing instructional content

--

  - What to do to achieve results

--
  
  - Plan holistically (systems thinking)

--

  - Consider feasibility
  
--

  - Add technology at the end

---

# `r fa("fas fa-mug-hot", fill = "#fff")` Designing Instruction

```{r, out.width = "360px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/teapot2.png")
```

### How can the desired results of instruction (i.e., the objectives) be achieved?

- **Instructional Tactics:** any instructional activity undertaken to facilitate a strategy

--

- See **Table 9.1** (pp. 146-149) for detailed overview of instructional strategies and tactics

---

# `r fa("fas fa-mug-hot", fill = "#fff")` Designing Instruction

### How to choose the mode of instruction?

---

# `r fa("fas fa-mug-hot", fill = "#fff")` Developing Materials

--

### Step 1: Prepare a Working Outline

--

- Who are the learners?

--

- Where are the learners functioning? (i.e., geographical location)

--

- When are the learners functioning? (i.e., is timing an issue?)

--

- How are learners functioning? (i.e., is that important to meet the learning objectives?)

--

- How important is it that some issues are covered?

--

- How well does the outline address all issues covered in the objectives?

--

- How is success in the program evaluated?

---

# `r fa("fas fa-mug-hot", fill = "#fff")` Developing Materials

### Step 2: Conduct Research

--

- **Materials Assessment:** interview knowledgeable people in the organization

--

  - Have you ever seen any procedure manuals, checklists, descriptive booklets, or training manuals on [subject name]?

--

  - Who do you know in this organization who is especially knowledgeable about this subject?

--

  - What department(s) might have needed, in the past, to do special training on the subject?

--

### Step 3: Examine Existing Intructional Materials

--

- **Materials Analysis**

--

### Step 4: Arrange or Modify Existing Materials

---

# `r fa("fas fa-mug-hot", fill = "#fff")` Developing Materials

```{r, out.width = "560px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/teapot4.png")
```

### Final key question: 

--

- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**

--

  - Will the benefits of buying and modifying instruction from an external source outweigh the costs associated with tailoring them to meet the unique needs for a targeted group?
